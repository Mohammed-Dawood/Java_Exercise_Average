This Java program asks the user to enter three numbers, calculates their average, and prints the result in a specific format. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user, performs arithmetic operations to calculate the average, and then displays the result in the form `(num1 + num2 + num3) / 3 = average`. The program ensures proper handling of user input using `nextInt()` method of `Scanner` and closes the input stream at the end to release system resources.
